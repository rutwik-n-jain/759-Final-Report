% Per-frame latency 
Figure~\ref{fig:framelatency} shows the latency incurred in performing computations and rendering each frame for a simulation of 1000 frames with varying number of boids. For a given simulation, the plot shows that per-frame latency is fairly consistent over time, and flocking performance can therefore be evaluated using average metrics such as frame rate (FPS). The plot also shows that naïve CPU-based boid-flocking scales poorly with increasing number of boids.
